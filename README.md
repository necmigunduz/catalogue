# Catalogue

This project is based on the catalogue of dog clothes project of Microverse where the goal is to make a browsable list of items
and a details page for each one of them. You can see all the specifications and requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Dog-Clothes-8bf1512b8ab34fa28848beb8ab698a32)

This app is a catalog of foods and drinks where the user can search for his favorite meals and apply filters on his search.
Every meal has a details page that the user can access by clicking on the title and see the ingredients of the meal and a link to the recipe.
The data are being pulled from the Edamam Recipies API.
